## React-Calendar-Events-Example
This is a simple progressive web app react application that showcases CRUD operation in react redux.

<a href="https://github.com/YouCanBookMe/react-datetime"> react-datetime </a> components to add and remove events to a calendar.

It also showcases the use of <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage"> localForage </a> to store the calendar events for offline use as well as to retrieve it in future instances.

To clone and run  this application locally, execute the following command:
